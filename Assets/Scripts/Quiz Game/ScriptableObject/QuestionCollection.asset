  - questionText: In one of the simulations, we simulated the pop and push behavior
      with boxes. What data structures was that simulation supposed to be?
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 1b6ca4b19fe5c684abff09dddc53e79b, type: 3}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Stack
    hint: Remember what data structure has the pop and push method
    explanation: Stack uses the pop and push method for adding and removing entries
      in it

  - questionText: In one of the simulations, we simulate a line for buying a ticket
      to a museum. What kind of data structure that we use to simulate it?
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Queue
    hint: "Imagine you\u2019re waiting in a line what does that look like as a data
      structure?"
    explanation: Queue uses a First-In-First-Out just like how a line works. Also,
      Queue is a synonym for the word Line.

  - questionText: "The B\xFCrgeramt office decides to implement a new waiting number
      system. This new system gives out waiting numbers from lowest to highest in
      order and calls out numbers from lowest to highest in order. What data structure
      would this new system uses? "
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 3f07313fdceabe5439d033582a0e4cf9, type: 3}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Queue
    hint: If we imagine inputting the number in order from lowest first to highest
      last and outputting the lowest first to highest last what does that look like?
    explanation: ' Queue would be an ideal data structure to use because of the First-In-First-Out
      order of operation.'

  - questionText: Everyone is familiar with the undo button in most modern programs.
      Knowing how it functions what data structure is used to implement this functionality?
    questionType: 0
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Stack
    hint: An undo button works by rolling back your last action in the saved state.
      Now why does that sound familiar?
    explanation: Most programs use Stack to implement an undo functionality because
      you need to get the last action a user executes and Stack gives easy access
      to the user's previous actions and grabs it in order.

  - questionText: In Dungeon & Dragons, the dungeon master usually has to keep track
      of each character's turn order in combat manually. If we want to automate this
      process with a program what type of data structure would be perfect?
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Queue
    hint: In D&D the DM keeps track of turn order by ordering which character rolls
      the highest initiative with a d20 dice. Whoever has the highest numbers will
      act first followed by a lower number until everyone has their turns.
    explanation: Queue would be perfect for this. All we need to do is enqueue the
      characters from highest to lowest rolls and dequeue whoever is the first character
      to act.

  - questionText: Everyone knows how to play the Tower of Hanoi right? The goal of
      the game is to put all the disks in the last rod by only moving one disk at
      a time. If we look at how the game is played what data structure does this
      remind us of?
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Stack
    hint: In this game, you can only move the top of each position one at a time.
    explanation: Tower of Hanoi is a classic example of how Stack works. The way
      that you can only move the top of each stack one at a time resembles how Stack
      works.

  - questionText: "Let\u2019s program a simple calculator that does a simple subtraction
      and addition of small integers. If we think about how a calculator works what
      data structure should we use?"
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Stack
    hint: A calculator uses a postfix expression to evaluate the operands inputted
      by the user also known as reverse polish notation.
    explanation: Stack is the ideal data structure to implement a reverse polish
      notation method of evaluating inputs.

  - questionText: Web servers are an integral part of how we communicate through
      the internet. If we want to implement a web server what data structure should
      we use?
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Queue
    hint: A web server works by receiving requests from the internet and then executing
      them in order.
    explanation: A web server typically uses Queue to manage incoming requests and
      process them in order from earliest to latest.

  - questionText: In Java, methods are called from top to bottom. To keep track of
      the methods and their order what data structure is used in Java Virtual Machine(JVM)?
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Stack
    hint: JVM needs some way to keep track of which methods are called first after
      storing them.
    explanation: JVM uses Stack to keep track of stored methods calls. JVM itself
      has its own implementation of Stack.

  - questionText: At some point in life, we all had to print multiple files with
      multiple pages from the same printers on the same day. What type of data structure
      that a printer used to keep track of what to print first?
    questionType: 1
    questionImage: {fileID: 0}
    questionVideo: {fileID: 0}
    correctAnswer: Queue
    hint: The printer needs to keep track of what order should it print first.
    explanation: The printer use Queue to process the order in which print jobs are
      supposed to be done first so that it would not print the file in a weird order.
