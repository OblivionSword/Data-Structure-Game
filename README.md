# Stack or Queues
## Description
This prototype was created for my bachelor thesis. It is a game prototype for an educational game about data structure more specifically on stack and queue.

The game is split into 2 parts the simulation and the quiz game.

## Simulation
In this part, we simulated the stack and queue with simple interactive visualization.

### Stack
Here we simulate the behavior of Stack by using stack of boxes.

### Queue
Here we simulate the behavior of Queue by using a queue for using the teleportation device.

## Quiz
In this part, the player plays a quiz game where they need to drag the answer into the answer box.

The player can also press the hint button to get a hint on the answer.
